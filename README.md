# popularity_MLR_model_spotify

*My personal contributions to the group project were a portion of the exploratory analysis and all of the K-Pop subgenre regression analysis*
### Summary
Our goal is to find the best model to predict the popularity of a track based on other metrics measured by Spotify and to gain inferential insight into which predictors are significant in this prediction. The popularity of a track is calculated based on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. Since our data set is based on subjective traits that are difficult to measure, our R2 is relatively low. Looking at other notebooks, the R2 for baseline linear models was consistently below 0.1.
